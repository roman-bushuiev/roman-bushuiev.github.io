👋 I'm a second-year PhD student at IOCB Prague and the Czech Technical University, co-supervised by [Dr. Tomáš Pluskal](https://pluskal.group.uochb.cz/en) and [Dr. Josef Sivic](https://impact.ciirc.cvut.cz/). My primary research interest lies in developing machine learning methods for discovering new molecules from nature (e.g., new medicines from plants).

During my undergraduate studies, I focused on machine learning for enzyme function prediction. I also collaborate closely with my twin brother, [Anton Bushuiev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anton-bushuiev/?originalSubdomain=cz), on machine learning methods in protein science, including the design of protein-protein interactions and the customization of protein language models for specific proteins.

I'm particularly passionate about the biological discoveries and real-world impact that machine learning can unlock, rather than focusing purely on methodological innovation. I deeply value collaboration—please feel free to reach out! 😉

Outside of research, I enjoy exploring art and doing sports, espcecially Uechi-Ryū karate at the dojo of my research supervisor, Dr. Tomáš Pluskal.
